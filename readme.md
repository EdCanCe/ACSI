# ACSI

A nurse's office is the first point of contact between a person and a hospital. Therefore, it is essential to have the fastest possible way to manage and organize the data, as this makes contact with the hospital much easier.

The project is presented with the purpose of assisting in the management of information in a school nurse's office in a dynamic way, facilitating the registration of patients in the office. It has been observed that most school nurse's offices keep patient information on paper forms, which leads to various problems, thus hindering effectiveness.

Because of this, it has been decided to undertake this project, named ACSI (Institutional Health Centers Administrator), to prevent these problems by improving efficiency and ease of operations in a school nurse's office, significantly reducing the time needed to obtain or register patient data.
